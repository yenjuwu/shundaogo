Welcome!  It appears you are looking in the /templates/ folder for WC Vendors Pro.  Cool!  You're close to customizing the heck out of your website by using our powerful templates.  Here's how to actually do it.  For this example, we'll copy the add/edit product template for customization:

1.) Copy /wp-content/plugins/wc-vendors-pro/templates/dashboard/product-edit.php to /wp-content/themes/YOURTHEME/wc-vendors/dashboard/product-edit.php -- 

That's it!  Just copy it and maintain the directory structure.  Now you can modify the template in any way you see fit.  Of course, our core templates are updated from time to time, so if you update Pro / Free and are overriding templates, make sure you read the changelog for a list of templates (if any) that have changed for that release.  You can always visit wp-admin > WooCommerce > System Status > scroll to the bottom to see the WC Vendors Pro templates that are out of date.
