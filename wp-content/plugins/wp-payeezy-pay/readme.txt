Connects a WordPress site to First Data's Payeezy Gateway using the Payment Page/Hosted Checkout method of integration. 

== Description ==

Plugin creates a shortcode that when placed in the page or a post, generates a payment form for a Payeezy Payment Page. The published form includes:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Company Name (optional)
* Street Address
* City
* State (dropdown)
* Zip Code
* Country (dropdown)
* Email Address (optional)
* Phone Number (optional)
* x_invoice_num (optional)
* x_po_num (optional)
* x_reference_3 (optional)
* User Defined 1 (optional)
* User Defined 2 (optional)
* User Defined 3 (optional)
* Amount (optionally recurring every month)
* "Pay Now", "Donate Now", "Continue", "Continue to Secure Form", or "Make it So" button

Once a cardholder enters their information, they press the "Pay Now" or “Donate Now” button. They are then redirected to the secure Payeezy payment form hosted by First Data where they finish entering their information including credit card number, expiration date, and security code. The cardholder then clicks "Pay with your credit card" and the payment is made. Once the transaction is complete, the user is provided a receipt. They can then click a link and be redirected back to the original website. 

== Installation ==

**From your WordPress dashboard**

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'.

2. Search for 'WP Payeezy Pay'.

3. Activate WP Payeezy Pay from your Plugins page.

**From WordPress.org**

1. Download WP Payeezy Pay.

2. Upload the 'WP Payeezy Pay' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...).

3. Activate WP Payeezy Pay from your Plugins page. 

**Once Activated**

1. Visit 'Menu > WP Payeezy Pay > and enter the Payment Page ID and the Transaction Key. These values are obtained in Payeezy. Also enter a currency code. If your account is setup for US Dollars, enter USD.

2. Choose the Mode you wish to use, Live for a production account, one that actually processes credit cards, or Demo for a non-production testing account.

3. Enter the Type of Transactions you want the Payment Page to make:

    * Payments  - All payments are done on a singular basis. 

    * Payments with optional Recurring - Customer has the option of clicking a box that will repeat their payment automatically in 30 days. If they don’t click the box, the payment is handled as a single payment. Recurring payment will continue until the Payeezy Merchant Administrator goes into Recurring and suspends or deletes the Recurring payment.
 
    * Payments with automatic Recurring - Customer doesn’t get a checkbox to make the payment recurring. The transaction will automatically be made again in 30 days and will continue until the Payeezy Merchant Administrator goes into Recurring and suspends or deletes the Recurring payment. Good for gym memberships, karate schools, etc.

    * Donations - Cardholder will have the option of making a donation by selecting a predefined amount. If none of the predefined amounts are optimal, they can select “Other” and enter their own. Instead of a button labeled “Pay Now” to go to the secure payment form hosted by First Data, the button will be labeled “Donate Now.” 

    * Donations with optional Recurring - This is just like the above, but it gives the cardholder the option of making their donation on a monthly recurring basis by clicking a box. Recurring donations will continue until the Payeezy Merchant Administrator goes into Recurring and suspends or deletes the Recurring donation. 

4. Enter names for the optional payment form fields that you would like to use with your payment form. If you leave any of these fields blank, they will not appear on the published payment for. For example, if you want your customers to enter their invoice number on the bill they are paying, you would enter "Invoice Number" in the x_invoice_num field. A field will then appear on the published payment form for Invoice Number. The value entered by the cardholder will be passed on to Payeezy and it will be part of the transaction record. 

5. Press 'Save Settings'.


**Once Configured**

1. To add a payment form to a Post or a Page, simply add the '[wp_payeezy_payment_form]' shortcode to content. 

2. Publish the Post or Page. 

3. That's it! 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin an official First Data Payeezy product? =

No. I use to work for First Data supporting their various e-commerce products. This plugin is independent of First Data Payeezy but was built using their [sample code](https://support.payeezy.com/hc/en-us/articles/204011429-Sample-Code-for-Creating-a-Pay-Button-to-use-with-a-Hosted-Payment-Page) on my own time.

== Changelog ==


= 2.78 =

* Response Key field was mistakenly made a required field. I corrected that.

= 2.77 =

* Converted Currency Code to a dropdown. Added Response Key field. 

= 2.76 =

* Removed the option of selecting x_type. It was causing intermittent errors on too many installations. Transactions will be processed as Authorization and Capture. 

= 2.75 =

* Fixed a bug that stopped the ability to change/update the currency type.

= 2.74 =

* Changed the way the form uses CSS. It's now included in the form instead of pulling it from a separate CSS file.  
* Changed the way the pay.php, donate.php, donate-rec, and pay-rec process x_type. The way it was included in the file was throwing intermittent errors.  

= 2.73 =

* Corrected an image link. 
* Added donation button. 

= 2.72 =

* Added the ability to process transactions as authorization-only transactions. 
* Corrected the spelling of "Provence."  

= 2.71 =

* Added states and countries directly to the main plugin file. 

= 2.70 =

* Did away with the need to save the Transaction Key after upgrading the plugin to the latest version. It will now happen automatically during the activation process. 

= 2.67 =

* The transaction key file is now named after the Payment Page ID. This should enable this plugin to be used multisite.
* Added the x_company field as one of the optional fields.
* Add x_description back to the optional fields. I don’t remember ever removing it, so it must have been by mistake. I made it a textarea field since Payeezy doesn’t seem to have any character restrictions. Most fields are caped at 30 characters. This field has no such restrictions. I’ve tested it with hundreds of words without any errors. If you want a field for the cardholder to write a book, this is the one you want to use.
* Removed unnecessary css from the admin screen.

= 2.66 =

* State and Country selectors now show "Select a State" or "Select a Country" instead of the first option.

= 2.60 =

* Added the ability to change the text on the submit button.
* Direct link to the stylesheet in the plugin editor.

= 2.0 = 

* Combined this plugin with my other plugin, WP Payeezy Donate. All features found in that plugin are now rolled into this plugin. Going forward, this will be the only plugin updated, assuming updates are needed. If you select a Transaction Type option that supports Recurring and if you save the settings without entering a Recurring Billing ID, an error is displayed. If the mode is set to Demo, it now displays a notice. I also corrected a few typos and commented most of the code.

= 1.3 = 

* Fixed a typo that wasn't allowing x_reference_3 to work.

= 1.1 =

= 1.0 =

= 2.1 = 

* IMPORTANT! After upgrading, make sure you go into the plugin's settings and press the blue "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the page. I made a somewhat major change that strengthens the security of the plugin. The Transaction Key is no longer visible in the HTML form. It's now stored in a tiny file called key.php located in the plugin's directory.  If you don't press "Save Changes" it will not save the Transaction Key to this new file. I also included an internal style sheet for the form. Each field now has an ID that will make customizing it much easier. 

= 2.0 =

= 1.2 = 

I had to remove the ability to do Recurring. Was causing an error if no Recurring Plan ID was entered in the settings. The ability to add Recurring will be added back in a future update. Stay tuned!

= 1.1 =

Fixed form fields so that they are required to be filled in by the cardholder. If you include a field in the form, the cardholder will not be allowed to proceed to Payeezy until they enter something.
